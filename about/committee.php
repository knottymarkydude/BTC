                <p>The role is very varied, ranging from official duties of chairing meetings, agreeing agendas,

                    It also involves more ceremonial duties including some public speaking whilst presenting 
                    prizes at events and at the annual prize giving dinner. Other duties include resolving issues 
                    arising from the general membership and the committee; mediating, negotiating and being open 
                    and approachable whilst ensuring confidentiality. 
                    The role is quite time consuming and I would estimate that it takes in excess of 4hrs per week.</p>

                <h3>Membership Secretary Job Description</h3>
                <p>Responsibilities and Duties:<br/><br/>

                    The role is to encourage, explain, gain and maintain club members. Position roles/duties include: 
                    1. Respond to direct membership enquiries from club webmail, committee or members 
                    2. Support Social Media secretary on membership enquiries from any other source 
                    3. Ensure potential members are welcomed by committee members/coaches at trial/first event/session. 
                    4. When members join: 
                    4.1 send informal welcome by club email 
                    4.2 Send formal welcome from Mailchimp 
                    4.3 Inform Social Media secretary to invite to Facebook page 
                    4.4 Update membership spreadsheet 
                    4.5 Introduce to club with blog on club Facebook page 
                    4.6 Send membership card to new members 
                    4.7 Issue to committee/coaches/dropbox updated membership list on monthly basis 
                    5. Reconcile membership payments with Treasurer 
                    6. Manage annual membership renewals 
                    7. Manage affiliations of members to UKA 
                    It takes around an hour to complete a new membership so not onerous although can be longer if extended email exchanges to answer membership enquiries and present rate is 4-6 per month. 
                    The role takes a max 2-3 hours per week and often evenings or weekends, although the annual renewal is the biggest task and for 130+ members probably represents a week’s work spread out during December/January.

                <h3>Training Coordinator Job Description</h3>
                <p>Responsibilities and Duties:<br/><br/>
                    The role makes sure that we have coaches and leaders available for 
                    the sessions the club puts on. Towards the end of the month I send a 
                    spreadsheet out to all the coaches and run/ride leaders containing dates 
                    and times for the following months’ sessions. They will then respond with 
                    their availability and I try to match sessions with available coaches for the 
                    month so that the load is spread evenly and hopefully fairly between them all. 
                    I send the completed schedule back out so they all know what they are doing. 
                    On an ongoing basis I deal with any last minute changes that might occur due to 
                    coaches not being available for whatever reason. I write up the weekly “what’s on post” 
                    every Sunday afternoon. I also deal with the Meres for some of the pool bookings etc. 
                    In terms of time spent; it probably adds up to about 6-8 hours to get the monthly 
                    schedule sorted and perhaps between 1 and 2 hours on a weekly basis.
